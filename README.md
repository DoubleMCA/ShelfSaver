# ShelfSaver

ShelfSaver watches the video folders you choose and shrinks the files that are worth
shrinking by converting them to x265 on your NVIDIA graphics card. It checks every new file
(length, tracks, plays from start to finish, meaningfully smaller) before it replaces the
original, and it never removes anything you did not agree to.

It runs on one Windows 11 PC with an NVIDIA graphics card, and you use it from a web page.

## Install

You need Windows 11, an NVIDIA graphics card and an internet connection.

1. Download or copy this folder to the PC.
2. Open PowerShell as administrator (right-click PowerShell, choose "Run as administrator").
3. Run:

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1
   ```

The script installs Python and FFmpeg if they are missing, puts the program in
`C:\Program Files\ShelfSaver`, sets it to start with the PC, opens its port on Private
networks only, and prints the web address (port 8642) at the end.

Your settings, history and login live in `C:\ProgramData\ShelfSaver`. Only administrators
can open that folder.

To update, get the newer copy of this folder and run the same command again. The new version
is built first, then swapped in; if anything goes wrong the old version is put back. Your data
is left alone. Run setup from a folder outside `C:\Program Files\ShelfSaver`.

## Uninstall

In PowerShell as administrator:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install.ps1 -Uninstall
```

This stops ShelfSaver and removes the startup task, the firewall rule and the program folder.
Your settings and history are kept. To delete those too, add `-RemoveData`. Your video
libraries, holding folders and scratch disks are never touched.

## Compare quality before you commit

To see Low, Medium and High on your own TV, make short clips from one of your files. The
installer puts the tool at `C:\Program Files\ShelfSaver\scripts\make_compare_clips.py`. Run it from
PowerShell as administrator, so it uses the same FFmpeg that ShelfSaver does:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\ShelfSaver\venv\Scripts\python.exe" "C:\Program Files\ShelfSaver\scripts\make_compare_clips.py" --source "D:\Media\Movies\Example.mkv" --start 600 --seconds 30 --out "D:\Clips"
```

(From a development copy of this folder, `scripts\make_compare_clips.py` works the same way.)

This writes `Example Original.mkv`, `Example Low.mkv`, `Example Medium.mkv` and
`Example High.mkv` into the output folder and prints how big each one is. The output folder
must not be inside the folder of the source video. The source is never changed.

## Development

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
```

Tests marked `gpu` need an NVIDIA graphics card.
