# ShelfSaver container image (Linux, Intel Quick Sync or NVIDIA NVENC).
#
# Base: Debian 13 ("trixie"). Chosen for its FFmpeg: 7.1 or newer is needed because FFmpeg 6.1
# (Ubuntu 24.04's) drops HDR10 metadata when encoding with hevc_nvenc; 8.x keeps it.
# Debian's FFmpeg is built with both hevc_nvenc and hevc_qsv, so one image serves both GPUs.

# Standard labels. "source" is what GitHub's container registry reads to connect the package to
# this repository's page. They are plain metadata: nothing is sent anywhere.

# `apt-get upgrade` pulls in any security fix published since the base image was built (a stale
# base is the usual way an image ends up with known vulnerabilities). Rebuild regularly.
# non-free is needed only for intel-media-va-driver-non-free (Intel's complete media driver).
# --no-install-recommends keeps the image small; each package below is there for a reason:
#   ffmpeg                   the encoder itself (+ ffprobe)
#   python3 / python3-venv   ShelfSaver is Python; the venv keeps its libraries off the system's
#   libvpl2, libmfx-gen1.2   oneVPL runtime FFmpeg's Quick Sync support loads at run time
#   intel-media-va-driver-non-free  Intel's driver for the above (Quick Sync only)
#   vainfo                   lets ShelfSaver name the Intel GPU in its status (see encoders.py)
