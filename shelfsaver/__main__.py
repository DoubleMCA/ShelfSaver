    Why this is needed: uvicorn handles SIGTERM, shuts the web server down gracefully, then
    restores the previous signal handlers and re-sends the same signal to the process so the exit
    status looks right. Python's default action for SIGTERM is to kill the process on the spot,
    so the re-sent signal ended the program inside server.run(): the `finally` in main() never
    ran, the worker was never told to stop and ffmpeg was not asked to finish. With this handler
    in place uvicorn restores *it*, the re-sent signal just sets the stop flag, server.run()
    returns normally, and the worker shuts down in order.

    Windows does not deliver SIGTERM to Python (Ctrl+C arrives as KeyboardInterrupt, which
    already unwinds through `finally`), so nothing is installed there.
